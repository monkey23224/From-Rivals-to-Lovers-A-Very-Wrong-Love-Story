## About the Game

This is the **opening chapter** of a comedic BL visual novel.

The story introduces two male leads:

- A notorious, seemingly unhinged playboy from the capital — reckless, uncontrollable, and drawn to pleasure — who is in fact hiding old emotional wounds, using excess and desire to numb a fragile heart.
- A clever, stingy, quick-thinking straight guy who absolutely does not expect his life (or sexuality) to go off the rails.

Set between urban and rural China, this short opening focuses on character setup, tone, and the start of a rivalry that is clearly going to end very badly.
